# Pneumonia-Detection-using-Deep-Learning

## Overview
This project aims to detect pneumonia in medical chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of chest X-ray images to classify whether a given image contains signs of pneumonia or not.


## Background
Pneumonia is a common and potentially serious lung infection that can be diagnosed through medical imaging, such as chest X-rays. Deep learning models offer a powerful tool for automating the detection process, aiding healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and treatment.

## Dataset
Describe the dataset used for training and testing the model. Include details such as the number of images, classes, and any preprocessing steps applied.
